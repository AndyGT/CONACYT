    Text Categorization (TC), also known as Text Classification, is the task of automatically classifying a set of text documents into different categories from a predefined set. If a document belongs to exactly one of the categories, it is a single-label classification task; otherwise, it is a multi-label classification task. TC uses several tools from Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning (ML) and has received much attention in the last years from both researchers in the academia and industry developers. In this paper, we first categorize the documents using KNN based machine learning approach and then return the most relevant documents

    **Abstract(5)**
    Machine learning applications have been suggested for
    many tasks. We have investigated the suitability of applying
    machine learning to the problem of art identification, which
    we believe to be a new, but promising field. Our approach
    focuses on classifying works of seven different artists, by
    using a multi-class SVM with state-of-the-art features. Our
    results indicate that machine learning has good potential to
    classify art works. We conclude this paper by analyzing our
    results.

    **Abstract(27)**
    Designing computer programs to automatically categorize images using low-level features is a challenging
    research topic in computer vision. In this paper, we present a new learning technique, which
    extends Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL), and its application to the problem of region-based image
    categorization. Images are viewed as bags, each of which contains a number of instances
    corresponding to regions obtained from image segmentation. The standard MIL problem assumes
    that a bag is labeled positive if at least one of its instances is positive; otherwise, the bag is negative.
    In the proposed MIL framework, DD-SVM, a bag label is determined by some number of instances
    satisfying various properties. DD-SVM first learns a collection of instance prototypes according
    to a Diverse Density (DD) function. Each instance prototype represents a class of instances that is
    more likely to appear in bags with the specific label than in the other bags. A nonlinear mapping
    is then defined using the instance prototypes and maps every bag to a point in a new feature space,
    named the bag feature space. Finally, standard support vector machines are trained in the bag feature
    space. We provide experimental results on an image categorization problem and a drug activity
    prediction problem.
